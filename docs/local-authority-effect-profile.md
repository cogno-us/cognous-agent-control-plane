# Local authority/effect execution-claim profile

Status: **implemented proposal on Worker 21 branch; opt-in; not hub-selected**.

Profile: `urn:cognous:profiles:local-authority-effect:0.1.0-proposed`.

## Purpose

This contract is the Control Plane side of a bounded same-host profile that can
order authorization-critical invalidation against one protected SQLite effect.
The legacy `BoundedAuthorizationWorkflow.execute()` path is unchanged.

A claim is materialized only from:

- an immutable persisted `authorized` decision;
- the exact `AuthorizationBinding`;
- a fresh resolution of the same trusted workflow;
- the institution/domain and grant from the trusted Authority Context;
- current approval, policy and decision-relevant evidence state.

Possession of the claim does not authorize execution. A participating local
authority/effect store must provision the claim and become authoritative for all
subsequent invalidating writes in the profile.

## Claim bindings

The claim binds:

- institution and authority domain;
- actor, principal, grant ID and revision;
- decision and effect IDs;
- Manifest, action, adapter, target and exact operation commitment;
- approval state and commitment;
- policy state and commitment;
- evidence obligations/state/freshness inputs and commitment;
- requirement commitment;
- budget ID and maximum effects;
- not-before and expiry;
- profile version and complete claim commitment.

The optional `decision_input_commitment` and
`decision_input_profile_version` fields are opaque compatibility hooks for the
Decision Input Commitment profile now merged on Control Plane `main` at
`29337fe900d3b2da5656c77d56d70f18feb190b8`. Worker 21 does **not**
silently adopt that profile into the authority/effect runtime and does not
reinterpret the Decision Input Commitment Record as executable authority.

## Trust boundary

Claim issuance has two distinct APIs.

`materialize_local_execution_claim()` returns a validated, non-executable
snapshot artifact. It is not sufficient for the Worker 21 execution profile.

`provision_local_execution_claim()` defines the trusted authority handoff.
The resolver must expose an `authority_effect_handoff` boundary that excludes
all trusted authority-invalidating writers while the Control Plane performs the
final resolve, captures one coherent authority snapshot, validates active/current
grant, approval, policy and evidence projections, constructs the claim, and
provisions that exact claim into the participating executor store.

Only after the provisioning callback returns does the local SQLite store become
authoritative for subsequent profile mutations. A second ordinary resolver check
without this exclusion-and-provisioning handoff does not establish the profile.

The claim is still not cryptographic authority. The corresponding executor must
validate and consume the provisioned claim in the same authoritative SQLite
transaction as the protected effect.

## Compatibility

- No existing Control Plane schema changes.
- No changes to `RuntimeDecision`, `AuthorizationBinding` or
  `BoundedRunRecord`.
- Existing consumers remain compatible.
- The existing execution path remains selected unless an integrator explicitly
  opts into the new local profile.
- The merged Worker 20 Decision Input Commitment profile remains independent
  and non-authorizing; Worker 21 uses only optional opaque linkage fields unless
  a later explicit integration is reviewed.

## Not claimed

This profile does not establish production identity, source authenticity,
distributed transactions, remote revocation, universal mediation, external
destination atomicity, EBL-Core conformance, or production readiness.
