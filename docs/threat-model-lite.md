# Threat Model (Lite)

This document outlines what Agent Control Plane helps with and what it
does not solve.  It is intentionally concise.

## What this MVP helps with

### Unrecorded agent actions

**Risk**: an agent calls tools without any record, making it impossible to
audit what happened.

**Mitigation**: every `ActionProposal` is recorded before any tool is
called, regardless of whether the action is allowed or blocked.

---

### Unauthorised tool use

**Risk**: an agent calls a tool that should not be accessible in the current
context (e.g. sending external emails without approval).

**Mitigation**: the `PolicyGate` checks every proposal against the Frame's
allow/block lists and the active authority records.  Blocked tools and
unauthorised action types are rejected before execution.

---

### Missing blocked-action records

**Risk**: a blocked action leaves no trace, so auditors cannot tell whether
blocking occurred.

**Mitigation**: a `BlockedAction` record is automatically created for every
`block` decision and stored in the `RunRecord`.

---

### Inability to replay a run

**Risk**: there is no way to reconstruct exactly what an agent proposed,
decided, and output during a past run.

**Mitigation**: `generate_replay_bundle()` produces a self-contained
`ReplayBundle` that includes the frame, all proposals, decisions, authority
records, reliance records, blocked actions, and final output.

---

### External-source reliance ambiguity

**Risk**: the origin of information used by the agent is unknown, making
it hard to assess trustworthiness or identify data-quality issues.

**Mitigation**: `record_reliance()` captures each external source the agent
accessed, including source name, type, scope, and a link to the triggering
action.

---

### Inconsistent policy decisions

**Risk**: the same action evaluated twice produces different results,
making audits unreliable.

**Mitigation**: the `PolicyGate` is stateless and deterministic.  The
`deterministic_fingerprint` field provides a verifiable hash of the inputs
so that any re-evaluation of the same inputs produces the same fingerprint.

---

## What this MVP does NOT solve

### Model hallucination

Agent Control Plane records what the agent proposed and what the policy
decided.  It cannot detect or prevent hallucinated reasoning inside the
model that led to the proposal.

### Bad policy definitions

The gate enforces the policies you define.  If the allow/block lists or
authority scopes are misconfigured, the gate will enforce the misconfigured
policy faithfully.

### Compromised infrastructure

If the host environment, dependencies, or the process running the recorder
are compromised, the integrity of the records cannot be guaranteed by this
library alone.

### Complete compliance automation

This MVP provides structured records suitable for compliance workflows but
does not automate regulatory compliance, generate compliance reports, or
integrate with compliance management platforms.

### Full semantic understanding

The gate classifies actions by `tool_name` and `action_type` as declared
by the agent.  It does not inspect the semantic content of the `payload`
or infer intent from natural-language reasoning.
